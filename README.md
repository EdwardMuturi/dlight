## Dlight Interview Solution

### Architecture
Solution App using [Guide to app architecture](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/), in 100% Kotlin, using Android Jetpack Components.

### Prerequisites

Before running this app, you need to add your Github Personal Access Token, in your `local.properties` file:

```yaml
GITHUB_TOKEN="xxxx-xxxx-xxx"
```
Before every commit, make sure you run the following bash script:

```shell script
./codeAnalysis
```


### Background

Develop an application that uses Github REST APIs to achieve the following features:
1. Search for a user profile on Github and display his account details, including, but not
   limited to, image, bio, username and number of repositories.
2. Have the ability to display the user followers, and following lists. (the accounts that
   the user is following, and the accounts that are followed by the selected user)
3. Display a detail page of the user's repositories and display the repository details,
   including, but not limited to, name, stars and description.
4. This information should be saved in the database for offline use
